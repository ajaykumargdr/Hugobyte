# Rust Cargo Package Generate Module

This repository explores two different approaches for generating Rust Cargo packages. The project involves creating essential files, including src/main.rs and Cargo.toml in a manual approach, and using the `std::process::Command` module to automate the package generation.

### Approach 1 - Manual Package Generation

In this approach, the package generation process involves manually constructing the necessary project structure. It includes creating a Rust source file `main.rs` and a corresponding `Cargo.toml` file. The main.rs file contains a sample Rust program, and the Cargo.toml file specifies package details and dependencies.

### Approach 2 - Automated Package Generation

In the second approach, automation is achieved by utilizing the `std::process::Command` module. This approach involves executing the necessary commands to initiate the package creation process. The `cargo new` command is used to generate the package, creating the initial project. Subsequently, the `main.rs` and `Cargo.toml` files are written into the appropriate directories.

### Summary

Both approaches have their advantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your project. Manual package generation provides greater control and flexibility, allowing for customization of the code and package structure. On the other hand, automated package generation using `std::process::Command` offers convenience and speeds up the package creation process.
